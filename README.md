# SI649 Project 2

## About

This is the GitHub repository for the codes used to produce the interactive visualizations for Project 2.

The two visualizations that were redesigned were obtained from the article titled:

1. “Visualization of the Challenges and Limitations of the Long-Term Sunspot Number Record” [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11919.pdf)
2. “SPARCS, a platform for genome-scale CRISPR screening for spatial cellular phenotypes” [link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.542416v1.full.pdf)

## Data

The data used in the first visualization was obtained from [here](https://github.com/amunozj/NatAs_SN_Perspective) and the second one was from [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/SPARCS_pub_figures).

## Modification

The data used in the first visualization was modified to become interactive. The resulting data (all pickle files) used in the final visualization can be found in the `data` folder.
The code used to modify the data is named `NatAs_Data.ipynb`. 

The data used in the second visualization was not modified. It is stored in the `data` folder as well.

Please note that the relative link in the code might need some modification. All the data is stored in the folder `data`, but some file expect the data to be in the same folder. Do be mindful of this and either change the relative address or move the data to the same folder location as the code.
